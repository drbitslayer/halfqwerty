Need a one handed typing solution?

This is a simple windows hook that flips the keyboard while you press the space bar.

This makes it reasonably quick to adapt if you can't use one hand for some reason.

It doesn't matter if you can't type with your right XOR left hand because the keyboard's keys are flipped when you press the spacebar.

This makes it work for either hand.  

You can also just get good at using both hands and then you can type and drink coffee at the same time!
